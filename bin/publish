## Publish Script
## Cleans up the node_modules, re-installs everything, runs test before publishing
## By default, it will attempt to publish as next-gen, unless 'public' is provided
## i.e.
##    ./bin/publish public      publishes as a bump
##    ./bin/publish             publishes as next-gen

  fi
}

# Cleanup
run_script lerna clean -y
run_script rm -rf node_modules

# Install
run_script npm install

# Lint and test
run_script npm run lint
run_script npm run test

# Build
run_script npm run build

# Publish
