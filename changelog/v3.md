## 3.0.0 (October 15, 2019)

Create Flex Plugin 3.0 uses the [Twilio Functions & Assets API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions-assets-api) to build and deploy your plugin directly from the command line.

# Highlights

* Twilio Functions & Assets API support
* Bumped all dependencies to the latest version (Craco, Create React App, etc)
* Unified all scripts under a new `flex-plugin-scripts` repo

# Migrating from 2.x to 3.x

To update existing plugins, edit `package.json` and modify the `scripts`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "bootstrap": "flex-plugin check-start",
    "prebuild": "rimraf build && npm run bootstrap",
    "build": "flex-plugin build",
    "clear": "flex-plugin clear",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "flex-plugin deploy",
    "eject": "flex-plugin eject",
    "postinstall": "npm run bootstrap",
    "list": "flex-plugin list",
    "remove": "flex-plugin remove",
    "prestart": "npm run bootstrap",
    "start": "flex-plugin start",
    "test": "flex-plugin test --env=jsdom"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "craco-config-flex-plugin": "^3",
    "flex-plugin": "^3",
    "flex-plugin-scripts": "^3",
    "react": "16.5.2",
    "react-dom": "16.5.2",
    "react-scripts": "3.2.0",
    "rimraf": "^3.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@twilio/flex-ui": "^1",
    "babel-polyfill": "^6.26.0",
    "enzyme": "^3.10.0",
    "enzyme-adapter-react-16": "^1.14.0"
  }
}
```

The [Functions & Assets API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions-assets-api) uses a different version of Assets than the existing version of [Twilio Console Assets](https://www.twilio.com/console/assets). When you use the `deploy` command to deploy your plugin, you will need to delete the original plugin file from [Twilio Console Assets](https://www.twilio.com/console/assets). Otherwise Flex would attempt to load your plugin twice.

## Breaking Changes

Version 3 is backward compatible with version 2. This release adds a way to upload your plugin directly to Twilio without needing to drag-and-drop the bundle in the Twilio Console.

## New Features

### Deploying to Twilio Assets

The new Flex plugin builder adds the ability to deploy to Twilio Assets directly from your CLI. It enables you to build and deploy your plugins directly from the CLI by leveraging the Functions & Assets API. This allows you to integrate your plugin development within a CI/CD pipeline.
